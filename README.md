# Hi, I'm [Upton Stallman] 👋

I’m passionate about creating technology that empowers everyone — from beginners to experts — to learn, build, and innovate.

I believe that access to computing and software freedom aren’t just nice-to-haves, but fundamental rights that unlock creativity and opportunity around the world.

- 💡 Designing tools and platforms that make complex technology approachable and inclusive.  
- 🌍 Championing open collaboration, transparency, and community-driven progress.  
- 📚 Dedicated to education and sharing knowledge to help others thrive in the digital age.  
- 🔧 Always exploring ways to blend hardware and software for meaningful impact.  
- ⚡ Committed to challenging barriers and enabling people to use and shape technology.
